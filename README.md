# CPP-Spell-Checking-Program

Given a very large dictionary, write an efficient and scalable C++ spell-checking program. The program takes a random string as input and outputs the 10 best matches from the dictionary, in order of relevance.

For example, the input "potata" would output a list similar to this:
potato
potatoes
potash
...
(10 closest matches in order of relevance)
...
